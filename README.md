# üìä Wallet Risk Scoring System ‚Äì Zeru Finance Assignment

## üîç Objective

Build a wallet risk scoring model using on-chain activity data from Compound V3 transactions. The goal is to assign a **risk score between 0‚Äì1000** to each wallet address, identifying potentially risky behavior patterns based on transactional and behavioral attributes.

---

## üß† Approach

We adopted a hybrid **unsupervised ‚Üí interpretable** pipeline to score DeFi wallets, combining **Isolation Forest** (to model anomalous activity) and **Linear Regression** (to derive a simple, explainable formula).

### Step 1: Data Parsing & Cleaning

- Parsed nested JSON transaction data for 100 wallet addresses.
- Extracted raw event data such as function names, gas usage, status flags, block numbers, timestamps, etc.
- Merged data across wallets into a unified `DataFrame`.

### Step 2: Feature Engineering

Derived behavioral and statistical features for each wallet. Notable examples:

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `fn_entropy` | Entropy of function types (higher = more diverse activity) |
| `unique_to_ratio` | Ratio of unique recipients to total transactions |
| `fncount_approve_ratio` | Ratio of `approve()` function calls |
| `gas_std`, `gas_mean` | Variability and average of gas used |
| `tx_gap_std` | Standard deviation of time gaps between transactions |
| `value_sum` | Total transaction value across all events |
| `error_rate`, `fail_rate` | Fraction of failed/errored transactions |

In total, ~25 features were generated per wallet.

### Step 3: Risk Score Modeling (Unsupervised)

Used an **Isolation Forest** model to generate a raw anomaly score for each wallet. The model identifies outliers based on multivariate feature distribution.

- Tuned for `contamination="auto"` and fitted on all engineered features.
- Raw scores were scaled to a **0‚Äì1000** range to produce a human-readable **`scaled_risk_score`**.

### Step 4: Interpretable Risk Formula (Linear Regression)

To explain the risk computation in a simple, business-friendly way:

- Trained a **Linear Regression** model using top features to predict the Isolation Forest scores.
- Selected 6 most intuitive and important features based on:
  - XGBoost feature importance
  - Feature correlation with raw scores
  - Domain reasoning

**Final selected features:**

- `gas_std`
- `unique_to_ratio`
- `fncount_approve_ratio`
- `fn_entropy`
- `gas_mean`
- `tx_gap_std`

**Final scoring formula:**

```python
final_risk_score = (
    + 85 * gas_std
    - 99 * unique_to_ratio
    - 70 * fncount_approve_ratio
    - 3.4 * fn_entropy
    + 18 * gas_mean
    - 29 * tx_gap_std
)
```

These coefficients were extracted directly from the trained linear model and rounded for simplicity.

### üìà Results & Distribution

The final_risk_score was scaled to 0‚Äì1000 and shows a skewed distribution (most wallets are low-to-medium risk).

### üí° Possible Improvements (if more time allowed)

- Add more protocol-specific features (liquidations, borrow health).

- refine Isolation Forest parameters and scoring thresholds.

- fix skewed data thoroughly
